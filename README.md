###  Prettier example

* running `npm view prettier` gave an output saved in `data/`
* Assuming a package json with `prettier` version `^1.13.6` or laxer, you can see that when running `npm i`:
  * on the date of `2018-06-26` will install version 1.13.6
  * on the date of `2018-06-29` will install version 1.13.7
